# Quasar Firebase Sandbox

This sandbox includes a `client` and `server` project.

The purpose of this sandbox is to create a starting point for creating other projects using Quasar Framework and Firebase cloud.

This sandbox is built to use firebase emulators. You do NOT need to have a Firebsae account or a Firebase project to use this sandbox.

You will need to have the Firebase CLI installed (e.g. `npm i -g firebase-tools`).

## Client

The `client` folder contains a Quasar Framework v2 project using the Firebase Client v9 SDK.

- Install packages with `yarn`
- Run with `quasar dev`.

## Server

The `server` folder contains a Node.js project using Express.js and the Firebase Admin SDK.

- Change to the `functions` directory
- Install packages with `yarn`
- Run emulators with `yarn serve`
